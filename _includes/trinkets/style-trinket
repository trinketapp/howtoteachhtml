    <h2>Your Assignment</h2>
    <p>
        Notice that all of the paragraphs have the same 
        brown color.  That is because of instructions 
        in the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> at the top.
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
        Can you find <code>color: brown</code> and change
        it to be <code>color: blue</code>?  What happens?
    </li>
    <li>
        Can you find <code>font-size: 16px</code> and change
        it to be another number.  What happens?
    </li>
    <li>
        Can you change the background of the page to another color?
        HTML knows common color words like "red", "green", "blue",
        "organge", "pink", and "purple".  If you want a very 
        specific color you look up or find its RGB value.  
        Try <code>background: rgb(200, 150, 200);</code>
    </li>
    </ul>
